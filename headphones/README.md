# Headphones Landing Page

This project is a fully responsive landing page for a fictional headphones brand, designed by Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX designer). The goal is to replicate the provided designer files as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on accessibility and responsive design.

## Features
- **Pixel-perfect design** matching the provided desktop, tablet, and mobile mockups
- **Responsive layout**: Adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile (phone) screens
- **No external CSS frameworks**: Built from scratch using only HTML and CSS
- **No JavaScript**: All interactions and responsiveness are handled with CSS only
- **Accessible**: Semantic HTML and accessible design practices
- **Custom fonts**: Uses `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin-Cycle-OT`
- **Interactive elements**: Links and buttons have hover/active states
- **Content max width**: 1000px, centered on the page

- Do **not** use JavaScript

- Images and icons are responsive and scale appropriately.

## Interactions
- **Links**: On hover or active, links change color to `#FF6565`.
- **Buttons**: On hover or active, buttons have `opacity: 0.9`.

## Fonts
- **Source Sans Pro**: Used for most text content. Can be loaded via Google Fonts or included locally.
- **Spin-Cycle-OT**: Used for the logo. Should be included in the project files.
